NOW I make a leaf of Voices—for I have found nothing mightier than they are,  
And I have found that no word spoken, but is beautiful, in its place.

O what is it in me that makes me tremble so at voices?
Surely, whoever speaks to me in the right voice, him or her I shall
follow,  
As the water follows the moon, silently, with fluid steps, anywhere
around the globe.

All waits for the right voices;  
Where is the practiced and perfect organ? Where is the developed
Soul?  
For I see every word uttered thence, has deeper, sweeter, new sounds,
impossible on less terms.

I see brains and lips closed—tympans and temples unstruck,  
Until that comes which has the quality to strike and to unclose,
\
\
Until that comes which has the quality to bring forth what lies
slumbering, forever ready, in all words.
